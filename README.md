# social-distance-detector

This code will help you to do social distance detectioni in this COVID-19 situation at your premise. This is very basic code, feel free to checkout and do any improvisations.

You can change the socail distance threshold in program to make sure it works best for the your camera/input view. 
If you want to do more improvisation then you can calculate socail distance threshold dynamicaly based on human objects size so it will be more reliable in case of short and long distance view.

Steps to run the code :
  Install required libraries like opencv, numpy, imutils, math and time
  Link to Download yolov3.weights for COCO dataset - https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
  Put the downloaded yolov3.weights in your project folder.
  Run this code  : python SocialDistanceDetector.py
